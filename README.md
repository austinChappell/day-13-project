# Day 13 Assignment

## Project Details

This is an assignmentn in DOM manipulation using template literals.

### Things to know

We were given a mockup of the final outcome, and we had to recreate based off of the data given in the customers.js file. This file contained one large object of data called customers.

Using a for loop, I iterated through the results array inside customers, and saved the necessary data to variables. These variables were then called in a long template literal assigned to the innerHTML of container. This container variable was then appended to the body element.

The styling uses flex-box with wrapping to achieve the result. The social security numbers were given a filter property of blur to bring it out of focus. Upon hovering over the SSN, it becomes legible.
